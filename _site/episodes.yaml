          - lanipator: DOUBLE SUN... [lani and Vegeta3986 fight] fine... I'm just gonna go practice my Vegeta.  Ass.
        time: "2:48"
        explanation:  >
          <p>
            Double Sun... == <a href=3>Double Sunday</a>. It's one of <a href=4>Raditz's attacks</a> in DragonBall Z Budokai.
            As for the Lani/Vegeta3986 fight, apparently there were two early DBZ dubs: the <a href=1>Ocean</a> (heavily censored and edited) and <a href=2>Funimation</a> (far more faithful to the Japanese original) dub.
            Lani begins to say Double Sunday when he is interrupted by Vegeta3986 who then takes over the role, if you listen closely, you can recognize the voice change.  This appears to be a reference to the two dubs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, Raditz's "signature attack" was never given an exact name in the original series. However, like most unnamed attacks in Dragon Ball, the attack has been given several unofficial names by the various video games in the series, like "Keep Your Eye on the Birdie" and "Saturday Crush". "Double Sunday", the name that Lanipator uses, is actually the name of the dual energy blast that Raditz uses to sever Piccolo's arm. This explains the argument between Lanipator and Vegeta3986, as the name "Keep Your Eye on the Birdie" is prefered among fans.[1]

    info: A reference to <a href=1>Wrestlemania</a>.  The whole episode parodies it.  The battle parodies the tag-team, showboating antics of pro wrestling.

      - quote:
          - recoome: HIT… RECOOOOOME'S MUSIC!  (*Evil Horde - Hangarmageddon starts playing*)
          - recoome: Vegeta, you think that just because you’re the prince of all Saiyans you're the best there is at what you do. But let Recoome tell you something brother! You ain’t no Wolverine! And you ain't got what it takes to step up, to a FIVE...TIME...CHAMPION!
        explanation: <a href=1>Hangarmageddon</a> is a version of the E1M1, the theme song from <a href=2>Doom</a> (remember, Recoome rhymes with doom).  Recoome is a caricature of the typical WWE muscle bound wrestler.
