DBZ Abridged ranks right up there with The Simpsons and Futurama, IMHO.  Naturally,
it contains lots of obscure jokes which you'd have to scour the internet for minutes to find explanations for.  In an effort to utilize my
obsession with this show, I have pillaged the abridged forums and watched
every episode like 50 times to provide this content
