        time: "2:48"
        explanation:  >
          Double Sun... == Double Sunday. It's one of Raditz's attacks in DragonBall Z Budokai [1]
          As for the lani/Vegeta3986 fight, apparently there were two early DBZ dubs: the <a href=1>Ocean</a> and <a href=2>Funimation</a> dub
          Lani begins to say Double Sunday when he is interrupted by Vegeta3986 who then takes over the role, if you listen closely, you can recognize the voice change.
          This seems to be a reference to the two dubs.
          In the Funimation Dub, Chris Sabat voiced Vegeta, and also Raditz once when he made a reappearance in episode 89.  Lani also voices Vegeta and started out voicing raditz before being overtaken by Vegeta3986
