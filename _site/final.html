<p><b>Lanipator</b>: DOUBLE SUN... [lani and Vegeta3986 fight] fine... I'm just gonna go practice my Vegeta.  Ass.</p>
<p>Explanation: Double Sun... == Double Sunday. It's one of Raditz's attacks in DragonBall Z Budokai [1] As for the lani/Vegeta3986 fight, apparently there were two early DBZ dubs: the <a href='http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Ocean_Dub'>Ocean</a> and <a href='http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/FUNimation_Dub'>Funimation</a> dub Lani begins to say Double Sunday when he is interrupted by Vegeta3986 who then takes over the role, if you listen closely, you can recognize the voice change. This seems to be a reference to the two dubs. In the Funimation Dub, Chris Sabat voiced Vegeta, and also Raditz once when he made a reappearance in episode 89.  Lani also voices Vegeta and started out voicing raditz before being overtaken by Vegeta3986</p>

<h3>Episode 3: Happily Ever Afterlife</h3>
<p><b>Title explanation:</b> The episode is titled 'The Return of Radditz' despite Raditz never having actually been there in the first place.</p>
<a class='time' href='#'>0:22</a>
<p><b>Nappa</b>: Guy who's as strong as a saibaman says what?</p>
<p>Explanation: <a href='http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Saibaman''>Saibamen</a> are green humanoid characters that can be grown from a liquid concoction. Nappa grows them to fight against the Earthlings.  Each is as strong as Raditz.  That's right, Raditz was so weak, they could actually grow Raditzes.</p>

<a class='time' href='#'>6:37</a>
<p><b>King yemma</b>: And not just any Mahogany, but mahogany from Malchior 7 where the trees are 300 ft tall and breathe fire.  From these trees my desk was forged 2000 years ago using ancient blood rituals of the Malchior people.</p>
<p>Explanation: Just another play on the mahogany joke.  Malchior 7 doesn't seem to be a reference to anything (according to Google)the face on the malchior.  The face on the malchior people is <a href='http://abridgedseries.wikia.com/wiki/Lanipator'>Lanipator</a></p>
<h3>Episode 4: Snakeway to Heaven</h3>
<a class='time' href='#'>1:13</a>
<p><b>Goz and mez</b>: we are here to [clap], pump you up!</p>

<p><b>Nappa</b>: But, Vegeta, then you have to worry about the Fraggles.</p>
<p><b>Vegeta</b>: Oh God damn it, Nappa, nobody's going to get that.</p>
<p><b>Tien</b>: I did.</p>
<p>Explanation: Fraggles are humanoid characters from the Muppet show <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraggle_Rock'>Fraggle Rock</a> that eat radishes.  Nappa's joke mistakes 'Raditz' for 'Radish' (Raditz's name is a pun on the word 'Radish').  This constitutes the second Muppet reference in DBZ abridged (the first being Piccolo singing the <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N_tupPBtWQ'>Mahna Mahna</a> song)</p>

<p><b>Krillin</b>: KRILLIN LIMIT BREEEEEAK!!!! (uses scatter shot)</p>
<p><b>Sub</b>: victory music from FF7</p>
<p>Explanation: A reference to Final Fantasy 7.  Your character got closer and closer to its 'limit' as it took damage.  Once the character reached its 'limit' it could perform a special attack.  After Krillin destroys his opponent, the victory music from FF7 is played</p>

<p><b>Nappa</b>: I can't get it off, Vegeta!  Here, I'll use Rock Smash.</p>
<p><b>Tien</b>: Chiaotzu!  No!</p>
<p>Explanation: As TFS is fond of Pokemon references, this could very well be reference to <a href='http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rock_Smash_(move)'>Rock Smash</a></p>

<p><b>Piccolo and krillin</b>: KAGEBUSHIN NO JUTSU!</p>
<p><b>Nappa</b>: Vegeta!  I can't...."Believe it".</p>
<p>Explanation: "Full Nelson" is reference to episode 2 where Goku gets Raditz in a full nelson, and Piccolo blasts both of them. The latter two are Naruto references. "KAGEBUSHIN NO JUTSU!" is reference to the <a href='yar'>Shadow Clone Technique</a> from Naruto. "Believe it" is Naruto's catch phrase</p>
<a class='time' href='#'>5:07</a>

<p><b>Nappa</b>: I had a hell of a day, Vegeta.  I sank their battleship......and their whales.</p>
<p><b>Aquaman (offscreen)</b>: Nooooooooooooo.......</p>
<p>Explanation: 'battleship' is a reference to the game <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)'>Battleship</a> in which one can sink an opponent's battleships Aquaman screaming 'noooooooo' is a reference to episode 5, where the super friends convene to stop the Saiyans, and Aquaman can only offer his ability to speak to whales.</p>
<h3>Episode 9: The Set Up</h3>
<a class='time' href='#'>1:15</a>
<p><b>Nappa</b>: It's his turn Vegeta, I have to wait for him.</p>
<p><b>Krillin</b>: My turn, my turn, MY TURN!</p>

<p><b>Sub</b>: Silence</p>
<p><b>Oolong</b>: And remember the Red Ribbon Army?</p>
<p><b>Roshi</b>: Who?</p>
<p>Explanation: <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meanwhile,_back_at_the_ranch'>Meanwhile, back at the ranch ...</a>  is a phrase frequently used by narrators of American cowboy movies and TV shows as a segue from one scene to another. Launch lived in Roshi's house, because she was a good cook and Roshi was a perv.

<a class='time' href='#'>6:03</a>
<p><b>Researcher1</b>: … suck it, Spock!</p>
<p><b>Researcher2</b>: Well sir, I find it highly illogical to refer to this as a "ship"; the spherical design incorporates no propulsion system. It looks more like an orbiting vessel, or a satell—whaaa!</p>
<p>Explanation: I believe they are referencing the fact that the scientists are jolting around awkwardly, in a similar way that Family Guy portrays Captain Kirk.  Not entirely sure.</p>
